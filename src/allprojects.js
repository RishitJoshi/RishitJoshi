    description:
      "Deployed a model on flask that is trained on CNN using transfer learning approach to classify artifacts into three categories namely Basket, Coin, Figure. VGG19 is used for transfer learning approach with custom output layers. such techniques can help archaeologist in their assessment and classification of archaeological finds. ",
